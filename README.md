I created useFetch hook to make fetching data easier in my React app. Instead of writing the same code every time I want to get data from an API, I put it in this hook. It takes a URL, fetches the data, and keeps track if itâ€™s still loading or if there was an error. Then, my components can just use this hook to get the data and show loading or error messages automatically.
